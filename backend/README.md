# Mars Rover Photo API

> **Fork of [corincerami/mars-photo-api](https://github.com/corincerami/mars-photo-api)** (archived, GPL-3.0).
>
> Modified for self-hosting with Docker. Changes from the original:
> - Removed `rails_12factor` and `uglifier` gems (Heroku-specific)
> - Moved `puma` gem to top-level (was production-only)
> - `config/database.yml`: uses `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` env vars
> - `config/puma.rb`: Docker-ready config with `WEB_CONCURRENCY` and `RAILS_MAX_THREADS`
> - `config/initializers/redis.rb`: conditional SSL (only for `rediss://` URLs)
> - `config/environments/production.rb`: `force_ssl` controlled by env var (default off)
> - Added `Dockerfile` and `docker-entrypoint.sh` for containerized deployment

# Archive Only - This API is retired

I built this API as a student project back in 2014 and then rebuilt it in 2015. It then became a part of NASA's Open Data Portal in the fall of 2015. I've maintained this API for the last 10 years by myself, but I no longer have the time to properly maintain it. The search for other maintainers came up empty so this repo is now an archive only. If you are interested in using any of this code, feel free to fork it and use it however you'd like.


This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Perseverance and Curiosity rovers on Mars and make it more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists.

> **Note:** Opportunity and Spirit rover data was previously supported but has been removed. NASA retired the MER (Mars Exploration Rover) gallery and API endpoints in 2025, making it impossible to scrape new data for those rovers.

## API Keys

You can use the API key *DEMO_KEY* to check things out. However, if you will be intensively using the APIs to, say, support a mobile application, then you should sign up for a [NASA developer key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key). You can include this API key in a request with a query parameter `api_key=<YOUR_KEY>`.

## Photo Attributes

Each rover has its own set of photos stored in the database, which can be queried separately. There are several possible queries that can be made against the API. Photos are organized by the sol (Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken, counting up from the rover's landing date. A photo taken on Curiosity's 1000th Martian sol exploring Mars, for example, will have a sol attribute of 1000. If instead you prefer to search by the Earth date on which a photo was taken, you can do that too.

Along with querying by date, results can also be filtered by the camera with which it was taken. Each camera has a unique function and perspective, and they are named as follows:

### Cameras
#### Perseverance rover

  Abbreviation | Camera
  ------------ | ------------------------------
   EDL_RUCAM|Rover Up-Look Camera
   EDL_RDCAM|Rover Down-Look Camera
   EDL_DDCAM|Descent Stage Down-Look Camera
   EDL_PUCAM1|Parachute Up-Look Camera A
   EDL_PUCAM2|Parachute Up-Look Camera B
   NAVCAM_LEFT|Navigation Camera - Left
   NAVCAM_RIGHT|Navigation Camera - Right
   MCZ_RIGHT|Mast Camera Zoom - Right
   MCZ_LEFT|Mast Camera Zoom - Left
   FRONT_HAZCAM_LEFT_A|Front Hazard Avoidance Camera - Left
   FRONT_HAZCAM_RIGHT_A|Front Hazard Avoidance Camera - Right
   REAR_HAZCAM_LEFT|Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera - Left
   REAR_HAZCAM_RIGHT|Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera - Right
   SKYCAM|MEDA Skycam
   SHERLOC_WATSON|SHERLOC WATSON Camera

#### Curiosity rover

  Abbreviation | Camera
  ------------ | ------------------------------
   FHAZ|Front Hazard Avoidance Camera
   RHAZ|Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera
   MAST|Mast Camera
   CHEMCAM|Chemistry and Camera Complex
   MAHLI|Mars Hand Lens Imager
   MARDI|Mars Descent Imager
   NAVCAM|Navigation Camera

## Querying the API

The API can be queried in the following format:

### Photo Endpoint

#### Queries by Martian sol:

Queries by sol can range from 0, which is the date of landing, up to the current maximum in the database. The current max sol for each rover can be found at that rover's endpoint.

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?api_key=DEMO_KEY&sol=1000

#### Querying by Earth date:

Dates should be formatted as 'yyyy-mm-dd'. The earliest date available is the date of landing for each rover.

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?api_key=DEMO_KEY&earth_date=2015-6-3

#### Filtering Queries by Camera:

The camera parameter is not case sensitive, but must be one of the camera abbreviations listed in the table above for the respective rover.

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?api_key=DEMO_KEY&sol=1000&camera=fhaz

#### Query For Latest Photos

If you just want to receive photo data for the most recent Sol for which photos exist for a particular rover, you can visit the `/latest_photos` endpoint.

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/latest_photos?api_key=DEMO_KEY

### Mission Manifest Endpoint

A mission manifest is available for each Rover at the `/manifests/<rover_name>`. This manifest will list details of the Rover's mission to help narrow down photo queries to the API. The information in the manifest includes:

- name
- landing_date
- launch_date
- status
- max_sol
- max_date
- total_photos

It also includes a list of objects under the `photos` key which are grouped by `sol`, and each of which contains:

- sol
- total_photos
- cameras

An example entry from `/manifests/Curiosity` might look like:

```
{
  sol: 0,
  earth_date: "2012-08-06"
  total_photos: 3702,
  cameras: [
    "CHEMCAM",
    "FHAZ",
    "MARDI",
    "RHAZ"
  ]
}
```

This would tell you that this rover, on sol 0, took 3702 photos, and those are from among the CHEMCAM, FHAZ, MARDI, and RHAZ cameras.

The database will be updated regularly with the latest photos from the red planet.
